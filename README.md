# PrimesProgram
Graphical User Interface for checking primes.
Contains fields for input and output.
You're able to check if a number is a prime 
or you can find primes between two integers.

> *Threading is not well implemented and is unstable under high load*

## Guide
Search for prime numbers between
two numbers by inserting the number,
from which you want to start, under the
field where it says 'starting number'.
Insert the number, to which you want
the search to end, under the field where
it says 'ending number' and the press
Find primes!'
To check a single primes primality,
input the number under 'Single prime'
and press 'Check prime!'.
Negative numbers are not accepted.
Inputs are for integers only.
Other symbols besides numbers are not acceptable.
Try to search a small amount of numbers at one time
instead of searching, for example, between
one and a hundred million. That way the
program stays fast. 

***Enjoy!***
